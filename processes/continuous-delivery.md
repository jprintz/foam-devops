# Continuous Delivery

Continuous delivery mainly concerns the following steps in the DevOps process loop:

* Verify/Test
* Package/Build

In most places I've seen a description of what Continuous Delivery consists of the preceding steps of plan/create(code) are part of it too but to me it seems they are just a pre-requisite.
The delivery part of the process mainly consists of making sure that the build gets thoroughly tested and packaged. You then **deliver** that into the next "stage" [[continuous-deployment]].
What seems to be the cut-off for continuous delivery is when the product has run through all testing, packaged and gets **delivered** for approval to create a formal [[release]].
