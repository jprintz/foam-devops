# Git

Git is a distributed version control system. It is the de-facto standard. You will need how to use all the basic parts of Git to even begin to work with DevOps effectively.

A very short summary of how Git works in practice can be found below:

1. Create a "repository" on a central git host.
2. Copy ("clone") the repository to your local machine.
3. Make changes to the local repository.
4. "Push" changes from the local repository to the central repository.
5. "Pull" changes from the central repository to your local repository.
6. Create a version ("branch") of the repository that is separate from the main version.
7. Propose a change to the main branch (open a "pull request"). This means that you show what your version is changing and ask others to weigh in on them before:
8. "Merge" your version ("branch") to the main version.
