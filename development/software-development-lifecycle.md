# Software Development Lifecycle

SDLC is basically a list of different phases software runs through during it's creation and as it is utilized. The phases are as follows:

- Requirement Analysis
- Planning
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment

The idea is that you then loop through all these stages during a software's life, not always linearly.
