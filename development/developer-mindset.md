# Developer Mindset

I repeatedly read that you need a developer mindset to work in DevOps, but what does that mean?
As far as I gather it is mostly about knowing basic things about development. The things that I've seen the most are:

- [[Git]]
- [[Software Development Lifecycle|SDLC]] (Software Development Lifecycle)
- Programming
- Maintainability
