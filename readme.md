# DevOps Knowledge Base

**Welcome to my attempt at creating a DevOps Knowledge Base for myself!**

# What is this repository?

This is the start on my journey to actually learning how to do DevOps and acquire all the skills that I need. In the end I hope that I will have learnt enough to work as a DevOps Engineer or something related.
I am [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) for this as I am already using it for my personal notes. You should check it out if you are interested in personal knowledge management (think Roam, zettelkasten, etc.).
