# DevOps Knowledge Base

**Welcome to my attempt at creating a DevOps Knowledge Base for myself!**

# What is this repository?

This is the start on my journey to actually learning how to do DevOps and acquire all the skills that I need. In the end I hope that I will have learnt enough to work as a DevOps Engineer or something related.
I am using [Foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) for this as I am already using it for my personal notes. You should check it out if you are interested in personal knowledge management (think Roam, zettelkasten, etc.).

# Who am I?

My name is Julius Printz and I have worked in IT operations since 2012. Before that I studied Software Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology.

I have always had an interest in IT and how it relates to the actual user and find the principles in DevOps interesting because I feel like they have a focus on the reality of software and the users of said software. By that I mean that, to me, it seems that DevOps is about creating something that is actually **usable** and **relevant** to the user instead of delivering fluff that looks good on paper.

Quite frankly I've had enough experiences of managers and "higher-ups" that just want something to look or sound good instead of something that works and is actually needed by the business. That's were I hope that working with DevOps might eliminate most of the risk of having to deal with just that. I realize that, in the end, those people don't go away but hopefully a company that is committed to the DevOps practices have less of them.
